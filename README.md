# My dotfiles
These are my personal dotfiles (config files). Use at your own risk.
A general tip: Don't run random commands that you don't know.

## Install
```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Krist0FF-T/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
# create symlinks with stow
stow <packages you want to use>
```

## Update
```bash
cd dotfiles
git pull
```
